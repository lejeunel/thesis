\chapter{Deep Feature Learning}

\section{Introduction}

This chapter investigates several feature extraction methods as a contribution to the sparse point-wise annotation of the next chapter.

In section \ref{sec:cnn}, we give a brief introduction to Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) by starting from multi-layer perceptron (MLP).
In section \ref{sec:feat_method}, we introduce our experimental framework for the study of feature learning in the frame of our general problem of sparse point-wise annotation.
In particular, several baseline methods are introduced along the deep learning approach used in \cite{lejeune18}.
Extensive experiments are performed and results are given in section \ref{sec:feats_results}.
