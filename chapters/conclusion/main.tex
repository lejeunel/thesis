\chapter{Discussions, Conclusion and Future Works}
\glsresetall

This thesis provided a number of solutions to the general problem of producing pixel-wise segmentations of
medical sequences in a fast and intuitive manner.
Towards this goal, we have devised a fast and painless protocol that allows medical experts to provide annotations.
Using these, we proposed a number of solutions based on \gls{ml} and computer vision to infer accurate segmentations,
and proved their validity on a variety of imaging modalities.

In this last chapter, we provide discussions that summarize our findings.
In particular, we emphasize the overall chronological progressions of our contributions, starting from our \gls{pu} learning approach with a gradient boosting classifier.
Next, we summarize the results of our investigations on deep feature learning, and remind how the latter proved relevant in our next contribution, which relies on a multi-path tracking framework.
We then expose our improvements on the latter approach that rely on training a \gls{cnn} for foreground prediction using a non-biased risk estimator.

Last, we give a more general discussion on the problems that we managed to overcome throughout this thesis, the remaining limitations, and provide potential directions for future works.
