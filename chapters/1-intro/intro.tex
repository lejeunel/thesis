Object segmentation and detection in video and 3D image modalities are crucial problems in medical imaging. From brain tumors in MRI to surgical instruments in laparoscopic video sequences, supervised machine learning has provided reliable detection and segmention of structures of interest in various medical applications. To ensure good prediction performances, a cornerstone of most recent methods and in particular to deep learning methods, is the need for vasts amounts of images and annotations in order to optimize large numbers of model parameters.

Furthermore, while video and 3D image data are increasingly available, generating
ground truth annotations still remains one of the most fundamental bottlenecks
for creating truly large training datasets. Methods to reduce the annotation
burden have mainly centered on active learning,
domain adaptation and
crowd-sourcing, allowing experts and
non-experts to provide annotations in smaller amounts or in parallel. Yet, the
process of providing pixel-wise segmentation ground truth data remains prohibitively slow and tedious regardless.
