Recent machine learning strategies for segmentation tasks have shown great ability when trained on large pixel-wise annotated image datasets.
It remains a major challenge however to aggregate such datasets, as the time and monetary cost associated with collecting extensive annotations is extremely high. This is particularly the case for generating precise pixel-wise annotations in video and volumetric image data.
To this end, a previous work provides a framework to produce pixel-wise segmentations using minimal supervision by relying on 2D point supervision, whereby a single 2D location within an object of interest is provided on each image of the data.
The segmentation is then infered in a global way using the K-shortest paths algorithm.
The present work extends the latter by adding a deep embedded clustering step that allows to refine features and infer a pairwise similarity model.
