This chapter gives an overview of the vast spectrum of past research related to segmentation in the scenario of sparse supervision.
In particular, we focus on traditional computer vision techniques and
\gls{ml} methods.
Note that in practice, both categories often overlap.

The remaining of this chapter gives some background theory that is relevant to the methods proposed in the remaining of this thesis, namely Random Forest classification and Deep Learning methods.
