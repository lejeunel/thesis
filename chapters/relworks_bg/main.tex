This chapter gives an overview of the vast spectrum of past research related to segmentation in the scenario of sparse supervision.
We first focus on traditional computer vision techniques, and
move on to more recent \gls{ml} methods.
In a closing section, we give an overall comparison of the state-of-the-art
and further emphasize the relevance of the approaches proposed in the present thesis.
