This chapter gives an overview of the vast spectrum of past research related to segmentation in the scenario of sparse supervision.
We first focus on traditional computer vision techniques, and
move on to more recent \gls{ml} methods.

The remaining of this chapter gives some background theory that is relevant to the methods proposed in the remaining of this thesis, namely Random Forest classification, Deep Learning methods, linear programming, and bayesian parameter estimation.
This is intended to facilitate the understanding of the contributions of this thesis.
