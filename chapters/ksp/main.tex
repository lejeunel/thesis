\chapter{Iterative multi-path tracking for video and volume segmentation with sparse point supervision }
\label{ch:ksp}
\resetfigpath{ksp}
\glsresetall

This chapter proposes a novel method for the segmentation of medical videos and volumes using point-wise supervision.
Our basic idea is that the whole sequence to segment is composed of spatially and temporally ordered parts which are to be tracked by taking as cues the user-provided point annotations.
The pixelwise segmentation is then generated by aggregating these tracks.

We formulate our problem as the global optimization of a cost that includes unary terms, generated by a \gls{pu} model, while another models gives the pairwise similarities of regions.
In particular, the problem is first formulated as a \gls{map} problem, translated in the network flow paradigm, and solved using the K-shortest paths algorithm.
Additionally, we devise a self-supervised strategy that iteratively augments the set of positive regions using the solution of the previous tracking problem so as to retrain the \gls{pu} foreground model.

This chapter covers the content of our first journal publication \cite{lejeune18}.

\textbf{Author contributions} Jan Grossrieder has contributed to the feature learning component, as described in the previous chapter.
Raphael Sznitman has contributed to the methodology, in particular the formulation of the problem, as well as the analysis of results, design of experiments, and the writing of the manuscript.

\textbf{My contributions include}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Formulation of the overall segmentation problem as a multi-path tracking problem
