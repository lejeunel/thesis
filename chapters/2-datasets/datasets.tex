This chapter describes the datasets considered in the present thesis.
Tab. \ref{tab:dataset_stat} summarizes the 4 dataset types.
We used four different MRI brain sequences (A-D).
To augment the number of images for one dataset, the last three datasets (B-D) are combined into one larger dataset \textit{MRI Brain (B-D)}.
In a similar manner, dataset \textit{Slit-Lamp Retina (A-D)} is constructed from concatenating four independent datasets together.
The two independent datasets of the inner ear CT could not be concatenated due to different image resolutions.
